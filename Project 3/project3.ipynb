       " \"[Replimat] GARAK: It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it? Of course it is. May I introduce myself? BASHIR: Er, yes, yes, of course. GARAK: My name is Garak. Cardassian by birth, obviously. The only one of us left on this station, as a matter of fact, so I do appreciate making new friends whenever I can. You are new to this station, I believe. BASHIR: I am, yes. Though, though I understand you've been here quite a while. GARAK: Ah, you know of me then. BASHIR: Would you care for some of this Tarkalean tea? It's very good. GARAK: What a thoughtful young man. How nice that we've met. BASHIR: You know, some people say that you remained on DS Nine as the eyes and ears of your fellow Cardassians. GARAK: You don't say? Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered some sort of spy, are you? BASHIR: I wouldn't know, sir. GARAK: Ah. An open mind. The essence of intellect. As you may also know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so if you should require any apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor. BASHIR: You're very kind, Mister Garak. GARAK: Oh, it's just Garak. Plain, simple Garak. Now, good day to you, Doctor. I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today. \",\n",
       " \"[Ops] BASHIR: You won't never believe who just sat down next to me at the Replimat O'BRIEN: Major, upper pylon three'll be shut down for maintenance for forty-eight hours. BASHIR: The spy! Garak, the Cardassian. SISKO: We don't know for a fact Garak's a spy, Doctor. BASHIR: He is. You should have heard him. He introduced himself and he struck up conversation just like that. he was making contact with me, with me of all people. DAX: What do you think he might want from you, Julian? BASHIR: I don't know. Federation medical secrets? Rest assured they're safe with me, Commander. SISKO: I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir. BASHIR: In fact, Chief O'Brien, I think you should place a monitoring device on me. Well, just in case he's up to something? SISKO: I don't think that'll be necessary, Doctor. Just be very cautious when you're around him. KIRA: (who's had a hair cut) Commander? We've got a small craft taking evasive action. Cardassian war vessel in pursuit. SISKO: On screen. KIRA: That's Bajoran. That damned Cardassian's firing at a Bajoran scout ship in Bajoran space! SISKO: Mister O'Brien? O'BRIEN: Confirmed, sir. They've crossed into Bajoran space. SISKO: Open a hailing frequency to the Cardassians. O'BRIEN: Channel open. SISKO: Cardassian vessel, you are violating Bajoran space. Break off your pursuit. Repeat, break off now. O'BRIEN: No reply from the Cardassians. The Bajoran vessel is hailing us. SISKO: Open the channel. TAHNA [OC]: Space station, do you read? Space station O'BRIEN: We can only get audio, Commander. SISKO: This is Benjamin Sisko, Starfleet Commander of the station. Who are you? Why are they pursuing? TAHNA [OC]: Please! Repeating request for emergency docking! Please! DAX: The Bajoran scout ship is badly damaged. Structural integrity is failing. (The little ship gets hit again) DAX: He's breaking up. SISKO: Get him out, Mister O'Brien. O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. (KaBOOM, and a crouching figure is beamed in) BASHIR: Medical assistance to Ops. TAHNA: My name is Tahna Los. Request political asylum. Kira? (after the opening credits, medics are wheeling Tahna away) KIRA: His name is Tahna Los. We fought together in the underground. O'BRIEN: Commander, the Cardassians are hailing us. KIRA: Now they want to talk. O'BRIEN: They're hopping mad. SISKO: Open the channel, Mister O'Brien. GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a known criminal. You will turn him over to us. SISKO: He has requested asylum. GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: You have not granted it. SISKO: To be honest, I haven't decided yet. GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma! Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum. He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody. SISKO: I'll investigate the matter immediately. In the interim, if you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll be glad to hear an explanation for having violated Bajoran space and threatened a Federation facility. GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: We have made no threat to your facility. SISKO: I stand corrected. Sisko out. (transmission ends) SISKO: The Major and I will be at the Infirmary. I'd like some time to talk with this fellow Tahna. When Gul Danar comes in, it'd be nice if we had a few docking regulations to keep him outside a while. O'BRIEN: Understood. (Sisko and Kira get onto the lift) KIRA: You're not seriously considering handing Tahna over to the Cardassians? \"]"
